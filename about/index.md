I'm an italian web developer secretly in love with frontend technologies.  
I'm currently based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

!["That's my face!"](/images/bru-sportivo.jpg "Myself walking, somewhere in Italy")

I worked as a consultant for different startups and enterprises.  
My main area of interest is the front end development, but I try to have a 360Â° view
on all the technologies involved in the web development.

Some techs I've worked with:

+ **Javascript MVC frameworks**: Backbonejs, AngularJs, EmberJs
+ **HTML5 & Css3**
+ **NodeJs**: Standard Api, Express framework
+ **Php**:Symfony, Yii, CodeIgniter
+ **SQL Db**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite
+ **No-SQl Db**: MongoDB, Redis

I'm open to new and interesting offers. Feel free to [contact me](/contact/)!
